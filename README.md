# Right-Aligned Code

![Right-Aligned Code Demo](assets/fib-tabbing-demo.gif)

**Right-Aligned Code** is a simple Visual Studio Code extension that overrides the default tab and shift+tab behavior to use indentation widths based on the Fibonacci sequence (with a multiplier of 2). Instead of a fixed number of spaces per tab, each new indentation level uses the next Fibonacci number (times 2) for the number of spaces.

For example:

- The first indent level gives 2 spaces
- The second indent level gives 2 spaces
- The third indent level gives 4 spaces
- The fourth indent level gives 6 spaces
- The fifth indent level gives 10 spaces
- ...and so on, following the Fibonacci sequence (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...) × 2

This creates a visually interesting and non-linear indentation style.


## Features

- Overrides the default tab and shift+tab keys in the editor
- Indents and outdents lines using Fibonacci-spaced indentation (with a multiplier of 2)
- Works with any file type


## Requirements

No special requirements. Just install and use!


## Extension Settings

This extension does not add any custom settings.


## Known Issues

- Indentation is always spaces (not tabs)
- Indentation is based on leading spaces, not code structure


## Release Notes

### 0.0.1
- Initial release: Fibonacci-spaced tabbing override
